                    Animal Planet (stylized in all lowercase since 2018) is an American multinational pay television channel owned by the Warner Bros.
                    Discovery Networks unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. First established on June 1, 1996, the network is primarily devoted to series and 
                    documentaries about wild animals and domestic pets.

                    The channel was originally a joint venture with BBC Worldwide, and primarily focused on nature documentaries surrounding wildlife, targeting 
                    a family audience. In 2008, Animal Planet rebranded with a more mature programming direction, with a greater emphasis on aggressive and predatory 
                    portrayals of animals, as well as an increase in documentary-style reality series following personalities involved in animal-related occupations and 
                    investigations. Animal Planet rebranded again in October 2018, pivoting away from its more aggressive branding.

                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                Animal Planet was launched on June 1, 1996; it was created by Discovery Communications in cooperation with BBC Worldwide. On January 1, 1997, Animal Planet's 
                distribution grew as a result of Advance Entertainment Corporation selling the satellite transponder slot belonging to the WWOR EMI Service (a national superstation 
                feed of Secaucus, New Jersey/New York City's WWOR-TV, that was implemented following the 1989 passage of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule by the Federal 
                Communications Commission) to Discovery Communications, replacing the feed with Animal Planet outright.

                In late 2005, as part of a multi-million dollar expansion, the National Aquarium in Baltimore opened an exhibit called "Animal Planet Australia: Wild Extreme". Animal 
                Planet and the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced a multi-year partnership the year prior, which produced an original orientation film that gives Aquarium visitors 
                background on the Australian area which inspired the new exhibit and a dedicated area inside the expansion where visitors can learn about Animal Planet's conservation efforts
                and other programming. The partnership also allowed the possibility of future productions of television programs about the National Aquarium in Baltimore's research and exhibits.


                In 2006, BBC Worldwide sold its 20% interest in the flagship Animal Planet U.S. network back to Discovery Communications. The BBC maintained its 50% ownership 
                in Animal Planet's European, Asian and Latin American channels, as well as a minority interest in Animal Planet Japan and Animal Planet Canada until November 15, 
                2010, when BBC Worldwide sold 50% interest in Animal Planet and Liv to Discovery Communications for $156 million. Animal Planet is additionally an associate 
                member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.

                During the late 2000s, Genius Products announced a U.S. distribution agreement involving Animal Planet and TLC. Jakks Pacific also entered into a licensing
                 agreement to develop Animal Planet-branded pet products.
